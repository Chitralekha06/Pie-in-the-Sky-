Pie-in-the-Sky
IPL Match Bidding App

Pie-in-the-Sky is a mobile app that is used for bidding for IPL matches legally. Any registered user can bid for any of the IPL matches listed in it. New users or bidders need to register themselves into the app by providing their mobile phone number, email id, and password. Admin will maintain the match roster and keep updating other details in the system.

The app shows the match details which include the playing team, the venue of the match, and the current standing of the teams on the points table. It will display the winner at the end of the match and update the team standings in the tournament and bidder points table. System will send updates to the bidders whenever required. It will also generate the bidders' leaderboard.

App functionalities:

●	Predict Winner
The app allows the user to predict the winner of the match before the toss happens for the match on which the user is predicting. This is dynamic as the matches can have a different start time. Start time will also be influenced by disruptions like rains and other unforeseen circumstances. Users will not be able to see what others have predicted. Users can change the team bids only till the toss happens. Once the toss happens everything freezes for that match.

●	Point System
For every win, users get points. There are no negative points, meaning if the user loses the bid, he or she does not lose his/her points. The Point system is very dynamic. 
At the start of the tournament when every team is at zero points, every user who wins the prediction wins 2 points.
If the difference in the points between two teams playing, is <= 6, but > 0, then the person who predicts: 

-	Team with higher points will win, gets 2 points
  
-	Team with lower points will win, gets 3 points
  
If the difference in the points between two teams playing is > 6, then the person who predicts:

-	Team with higher points will win, gets 2 points
  
-	Team with lower points will win, gets 5 points

At every time the user will be able to see his/her points and his/her position in the overall user standings. He/she will also be able to see the top 3 leader positions
